## Shawn Chen

<img src="{{site.url}}/img/shawn_chen.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" width="25%">

A young man sits at a desk. His name is **Shawn**.

He's been there a long time... way too long. Honestly, he's probably just stuck in a loop of "just one more line of code".

At this point, he seems to be struggling. A faint voice can be heard offscreen:

"It's all part of his research. He likes it."

Maybe. Or maybe not.

After a brief pause, the voice continues:

"If you get close... he might offer you a drink."

Careful though, you never know what he will hand you.

But hey, don't worry, he’s friendly. So if you’re nearby, pull up a chair!
